Poject:Python program designed to be a student grade management system.

Objective:

The program aims to streamline the process of tracking and managing student grades. It allows users (teachers or students) to input grades for various subjects or assignments, calculate average grades, and view overall performance with additional information like letter grades or GPA (optional).

Key Activities:

Data Input: Users can enter grades for different subjects or assignments. The program stores these grades along with the subject names.
Calculation: The program calculates the average grade for each subject and the overall average across all subjects.
Output: The program displays the average grades along with optional letter grades (based on a 10-point scale) or GPA (example calculation provided).
Technology Used:

Python Programming Language: This is the core technology used to develop the program logic and functionalities.
Data Structures: The program utilizes dictionaries to store student information, with subjects as keys and lists of grades as values.
Functions: The program defines functions for specific tasks like calculating averages, assigning letter grades (optional), and handling user input/output.
